<h2><center><b> This project is broken down into 3 parts: </b></center></h2>
<p><b> Step 1: </b> You will find labels, make drawings, or take photos of the following: </p>

<p> A product containing <b>type 1 binary ionic compound</b>(one metals that forms one type of action and one nonmetal - <u>NO POLYATOMIC ION</u>) </p>

<p> A product <strike>contain</strike> containing a <b>type 2 binary ionic compound</b> (one transition metal that you must specify the charge that forms with one nonmetal - <i>NO POLYATOMIC ION</i>) </p>

<p> A product containing a <b>binary molecular compound</b> (only 2 elements, both of which are nonmetals) </p>

<p> A product containing an <b>acid</b>(This will say "acid" in the ingredients list)</p>

<p><mark><b>NOTE:</b></mark></p>
<p> Your product may use slightly <u>different</u> naming rules. If you are unsure, check with me! Make sure you use the standard naming system that we have learned in class when you name the compound!</p>
